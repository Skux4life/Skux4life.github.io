A program written in Python that will scrape data from Airbnb.
It takes in a destination and date range and will output a csv file with the relevant listings.
I found it much easier to filter options this way and used it to plan a weekend away.
One of the challenges is that the selectors used change frequently and so it is quite fragile.
